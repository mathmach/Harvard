Be the hero!

My project is an example to show my skills learned so far with the help of the CS50, using this knowledge to help COVID-19 hospitals.

First you will be presented with the initial screen with the possibility of logging in with your user. To begin, you must create your account by clicking on register and then entering your name, email and password.

Then you can log in and access the list of hospitals. Once you select the hospital you want to help, you will be redirected to a donation page with detailed information about that hospital and the amount you wish to donate.

Notes: This sample project is only for demonstration purpose and has no integration with payments, nor a very strong data verification.
